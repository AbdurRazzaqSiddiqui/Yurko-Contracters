            <h3>KITCHEN COMPANY THAT STICK TO TIMELINE</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>After hiring the right kitchen contractor and settling for a design for your home renovation,
                    the
                    next step is to order the necessary materials. This stage can take up to a month. It all depends
                    on
                    what you will be ordering and from where.</li>
                <li>On average, it takes 3 days to tear down the old kitchen or make the necessary structural
                    changes
                    like changing the location of the window or moving a wall. The demolition stage also includes
                    the
                    removal of existing countertops, cabinets, appliances, and flooring but it all comes down to the
                    expertise of kitchen company you are using.</li>
                <li>If you wish to change the location of your plumbing and utilities, doing so will take between 2
                    and
                    5 days. It takes 1 to 2 days for the electrician to relocate the electrical outlets and power
                    feeds
                    for appliances.</li>
                <li>Painting the ceiling and the walls will take 2 to 3 days. It depends on the size of your
                    kitchen.
                </li>
                <li>Prepping, installation, and priming of drywalls have to be done before the flooring is
                    installed.
                    This will take several days.</li>
