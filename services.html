            <h3>KITCHEN COMPANY THAT STICK TO TIMELINE</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>After hiring the right kitchen contractor and settling for a design for your home renovation,
                    the
                    next step is to order the necessary materials. This stage can take up to a month. It all depends
                    on
                    what you will be ordering and from where.</li>
                <li>On average, it takes 3 days to tear down the old kitchen or make the necessary structural
                    changes
                    like changing the location of the window or moving a wall. The demolition stage also includes
                    the
                    removal of existing countertops, cabinets, appliances, and flooring but it all comes down to the
                    expertise of kitchen company you are using.</li>
                <li>If you wish to change the location of your plumbing and utilities, doing so will take between 2
                    and
                    5 days. It takes 1 to 2 days for the electrician to relocate the electrical outlets and power
                    feeds
                    for appliances.</li>
                <li>Painting the ceiling and the walls will take 2 to 3 days. It depends on the size of your
                    kitchen.
                </li>
                <li>Prepping, installation, and priming of drywalls have to be done before the flooring is
                    installed.
                    This will take several days.</li>
                <li>The installation of your kitchen flooring will take 1 to 2 days. It depends on the selected
                    flooring
                    materials and the area being covered.</li>
                <li>The installation of cabinets takes 2 to 4 days. How long it takes to get them installed will
                    depend
                    on whether you are installing custom cabinets or prefabricated ones. How complex the
                    installation
                    process of the cabinets is will also affect the duration.</li>
                <li>A contractor will need at least one day to take measurements of the countertops and about 5 days
                    to
                    deliver the desired cabinets. The installation of the countertops may take 1 to 2 days. As the
                    countertops are being fabricated, you should be completing other tasks.</li>
                <li>The installation of plumbing will take 1 to 2 days. It takes at least 2 days for the HVAC and
                    other
                    electrical systems to be installed.</li>
                <li>On average, it takes 1 to 2 days for the appliances to be installed. This needs to be done after
                    the
                    utility connections are ready.</li>
                <li>If you need a backsplash, you should factor in 1 to 2 days. The duration will depend on the
                    materials being installed as well as the selected design.</li>
                <li>The installation of the sink and other appliances that aren’t affected by the installation of
                    other
                    countertops takes 1 to 2 days. The finish carpentry that involves floor trim cabinet adjustments
